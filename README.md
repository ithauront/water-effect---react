# Ripple Effect Background with React and Styled Components

This repository was created to help developers implement a ripple effect on mouse movement using React and Styled Components. The idea came from my personal need for this effect, and not finding any existing repositories that provided it for React(perhaps it exists, but I didn't find it), I decided to create this one to make it easier for others.

## Preview

  In this [https://ithauront.github.io/water-effect-react/](url) you can see the effect in action before downloading or cloning the repository.


## Features

    Ripple effect on mouse movement
    Easy customization of colors and background image
    Usability with React and Styled Components

## Customization

  * Colors: The colors of the ripple effect (ink) should be adjusted to match the colors of the chosen background. The transparency of the colors (on border, not on background) can also be modified to achieve the desired effect.
  *  Background Image: The background image can and should be changed to fit your project.

## Technologies Used

  *  React
